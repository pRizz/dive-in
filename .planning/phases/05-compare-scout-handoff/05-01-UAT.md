# UAT: Phase 5 — Compare + Scout Handoff

## Preconditions
- Extension installed in Docker Desktop from a recent build.
- At least two analyses completed and saved in history.

## Compare Flow
- [ ] Open History and select two entries (baseline + target).
- [ ] Compare action becomes available only when two entries are selected.
- [ ] Compare view renders summary deltas (size, efficiency, wasted bytes).
- [ ] Layer delta list renders and labels changes clearly.
- [ ] Changing selection updates the compare view cleanly.

## Scout Handoff
- [ ] "Open in Scout" triggers an external handoff when available.
- [ ] If Scout is unavailable, a clear fallback message is shown.

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Compare remains disabled with fewer than two selections.
- [ ] Removing a selected history entry clears comparison state gracefully.

## Notes
- Record screenshots or error messages here if issues are found.
